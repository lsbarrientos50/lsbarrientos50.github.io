In an effort consistent with the unavoidable need to link all sectors of society, as protagonists in
the preservation of our biological wealth, we present the second edition of the mammals chapter
of the Guía de campo de los mamíferos, anfibios y reptiles de Santa María (Boyacá); in which
we hope to contribute to the standardization of studies of small mammals, aimed at answering
questions regarding species richness, abundance of individuals within species and their diversity;
as well as to establish the composition, structure and function of this faunal group, among
other studies.

In addition, we seek through basic information on the biology and natural history
of the species, offer elements that link to the diversity of mammals present in the municipality
of Santa María, within the daily life, the traditional knowledge of the inhabitants of this municipality
and its visitors, and in regional management and conservation plans, since it is urgent
that this area be declared as a protected area, under one of the current legal concepts, for its characteristic
biotic elements and for being a biological corridor between the Chivor Hydroelectric
Power Plant and the Chingaza National Natural Park.
