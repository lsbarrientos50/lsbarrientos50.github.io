### A life long love for amphibians and reptiles

![](/images/herpLove_Lucas.jpeg){: .align-right}

I am herpetologist addressing a variety of research questions that I try to solve with the combination of tools of different fields as biodiversity, ecology, behavior, phylogenetics, systematics, population genetics, and biogeography.

I am interested in the evolutionary history mainly of amphibians. Using phylogenetic analysis, population genetics, biogeography and comparative methods to study the evolution of the traits. I am currently an assitant professor at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

I am particularly interested in studying evolutionary patterns and processes using direct developmental frogs from the new world as a study model. I am also interested in understanding how different traits evolved that facilitated the diversification of different groups of amphibians and reptiles.

I graduated with a B.Sc. in Biology from the University of Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia. During my master's studies at the National University of Bogotá, I focused my research in the use of frog songs as a source of phylogenetic characters. I have a PhD in Biology from the Universidad de los Andes. I joined the program and Andrew Crawford's Lab in 2010 with a grant from Cociencias Colombia. At the Universidad de los Andes, working on my thesis, I try to use genomic masive data to solve phylogenetics and biogeographic question on direct development frogs of the New World.
